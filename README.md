# rummy-core
:construction:

A very early stage library to model the card game of [Indian Rummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rummy).

One function that appears to work is `solveHand()`.
Given a hand of 13 cards and a wildcard joker, it returns all possible melds sorted in order of least points first. See `bin/test-solve.ts` for how to call it.



## Functional style

In the process of switching to functional programming style enabled by `fp-ts` and `ramda`, enforced by `eslint-plugin-functional`
